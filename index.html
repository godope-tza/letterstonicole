            <h1>To you, my soulmate Nicole</h1>
            <p class="date">June 29, 2024</p>
            <p>I hope this letter finds you well. As I sit here writing these words, my heart is in deep regrets
                for everything.</p>
            <p><strong> First I'd like to say thank you for being there for me always and making me the luckiest man in
                    the world.</strong></p>
            <p>I have been very unfair to you and I have been blinded by my own self all this while, you've given me
                multiple
                opportunities to be a better man to you and I have failed multiple times, it's all been playing in my
                head over and over
                and over again,</p>
            <p> <strong>Everytime I thought I was fixing things by being difficult and pushing buttons when I
                    could have been
                    kinder and still thought was okay are very unkind and selfish acts and I didn't see it
                    then.</strong></p>
            <p> I now
                understand and it
                hurts bad because I know it's all my fault and I should have been a better partner. Even asking you to
                take me back is
                honestly selfish considering it's not the first time any of this happened </p>
            <p> and I did tell you last time
                it wasn't going
                to happen again ( as I thought I had fixed my issues too), I should've worked on your issues first and
                understand fully
                what you want.</p>
            <p>Im asking you to please understand that at the time I thought it was going to help us and believed that.
                I have always
                considered you as the girl I want to be with forever and that's why I took that route thinking I was
                fixing you. I know
                and do see that I have not been that in times when you've needed me the most even, I have sat down now
                and thought about
                it all from our day one, to all the times I had been difficult while you just wanted to
                be understood by me and shown the love you want.</p>
            <p>I see it and I know my words won't mean much (not because you don't care but because I've asked for a
                chance before and
                I still end up fucking it up again and causing you more damage) so I understand you, and I shouldn't be
                asking you for
                anything at all but please just one request nakuomba please allow me to show you my changes, I won't ask
                you again to
                take me back unless I have fully shown you that I can be the man you want to live with for the rest of
                your life.</p>
            <p>I have been so blind and everything was just so open, and it took too much for this happen but I promise
                to be a better
                friend to you as it's the least I can do right now. And I know I shouldn't be begging you again and
                again to take me
                back, but Im asking for a chance to start from a friendship level. <strong> Its unfair to ask you not to
                    put
                    yourself
                    first and I'm
                    not going to, I want to learn being a good friend to you first, fix my communication skills and
                    being
                    more mature on
                    everything that I wasn't.</strong></p>
            <p>Thank you for being you, for your unwavering support, and for loving me unconditionally. <strong>I want
                    to be the
                    kind man that you deserve and treat you with the kind of love that resonates with you which is kind,
                    caring, full of empathy and unconditional.</strong></p>

                Forever yours,<br>
